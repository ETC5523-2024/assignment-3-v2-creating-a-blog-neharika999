    "text": "This analysis sought to uncover trends in the production, genres, and audience reception of summer-themed movies, highlighting how these films resonate with audiences across different categories. Our findings show that comedies and dramas dominate the genre landscape, capturing the spirit of summer with a balance of light-hearted and emotional storytelling. Meanwhile, documentaries and music-themed films also stand out with notably high ratings, suggesting that summer-themed movies have evolved to encompass a broader range of storytelling styles, appealing to diverse audience preferences.\nMoreover, the correlation between higher ratings and specific genres like documentaries highlights the “bandwagon effect,” where movies that capture a large audience often receive better ratings according to Limited (2024). The bandwagon effect suggests that well-rated films tend to gather momentum and achieve higher popularity, further solidifying their place in the summer movie canon.\nIn conclusion, summer-themed movies continue to offer a rich mix of genres, from feel-good comedies to thought-provoking documentaries. Their ability to engage a wide audience underscores their cultural relevance, with trends pointing towards an ever-expanding genre diversity that keeps the summer movie tradition alive."
