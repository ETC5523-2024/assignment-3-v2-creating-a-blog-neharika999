# Analysis of Trends,Genres and Popularity

![](summer-movies.jpg)

Summer-themed movies have always captured the magic of the season, whether through light-hearted comedies or dramatic tales of self-discovery. This blog post explores the trends in the production, genre distribution, and audience reception of summer-themed movies using IMDb data, aiming to understand how this niche has evolved over time.

## **Data Description**

1.  **Source of Data**: The data comes from IMDb, available via [@TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/readme.md) (dataset released on July 30, 2024).

2.  **Description of Variables in the Dataset**:

    **summer_movies.csv:**

    -   `tconst`: Unique identifier for each title (character)
    -   `title_type`: Format of the title (movie, video, or tvMovie) (character)
    -   `primary_title`: Popular title used for promotion (character)
    -   `original_title`: Original title in the original language (character)
    -   `year`: Release year (integer)
    -   `runtime_minutes`: Primary runtime in minutes (integer)
    -   `genres`: Up to three associated genres (character)
    -   `simple_title`: Lowercase title with punctuation removed (character)
    -   `average_rating`: Weighted average of user ratings on IMDb (double)
    -   `num_votes`: Number of votes received on IMDb (integer)

    **summer_movie_genres.csv:**

    -   `tconst`: Unique identifier for each title (character)
    -   `genres`: Individual genres associated with the title (character)
    -   The `summer_movie_genres` dataset contains individual genres associated with each movie.

3.  **Data Cleaning Steps**:

    -   **Handled Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing data entries to ensure completeness and accuracy in the analysis.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Removed Duplicates**: Checked for and eliminated any duplicate records to avoid over-representation of movies in the dataset.

    -   **Standardized Genre Formats**: Cleaned and standardized genre entries to ensure consistency, allowing for accurate genre analysis and visualization.

    -   **Filtered Out Irrelevant Data**: Removed movies with less than 10 IMDb votes to focus on titles with sufficient audience engagement.

    -   **Converted Data Types**: Ensured all columns, such as `year` and `runtime_minutes`, were in the correct data format (integer or character) for proper analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# snippet of the code which involves data cleaning
summer_movies <- summer_movies %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(genres = str_to_lower(genres))
```

The above code snippet demonstrates handling missing values by removing incomplete entries, eliminating duplicate records for accuracy, and standardizing genre formats by converting them to lowercase for consistency.

## Analysis

Let's dive into the trends and insights we uncovered.

**Trend in Summer Movie Production**

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(scales)
summer_movie_genres <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/summer_movie_genres.csv')
summer_movies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/summer_movies.csv')
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Number of Summer-Themed Movies Produced Each Year"
#| label: fig-movies
# Preparing the data 
release_timing <- summer_movies %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(movie_count = n()) %>% filter(year<2024)
# Plotting release timing
ggplot(release_timing, aes(x = year, y = movie_count)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year",y = "Number of Movies")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
We can observe a surge in the production of summer-themed movies during the 1980s and 1990s in @fig-movies, suggesting that this period was a golden era for summer films. While the trend fluctuated in the following years, it remains a popular genre with consistent releases.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 Genre Distribution of Summer-Themed Movies"
#| label: fig-distribution
# Reordering genres by count in descending order
top_genres <- summer_movie_genres %>%
  count(genres, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>%  
  mutate(genres = fct_reorder(genres, -n)) 

ggplot(top_genres, aes(x = genres, y = n)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Genres", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
