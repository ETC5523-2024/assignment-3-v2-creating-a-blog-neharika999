![](summer-movies.jpg)

Summer-themed movies have long captivated audiences with their blend of fun, adventure, and emotional storytelling, shaping cultural trends during the summer months. From blockbuster hits to indie gems, these films encapsulate the magic of the season, whether through light-hearted comedies or dramatic tales of self-discovery. This analysis dives into *IMDb data* to uncover key trends in the production, genre distribution, and audience reception of summer-themed movies, exploring how the appeal of this genre has evolved over time and continues to influence the cinematic landscape.

### Real-World Relevance

The rise of documentaries and biographical films in the summer movie space mirrors broader trends in the film industry, where audiences are increasingly looking for *authentic and educational* content. This shift could also reflect the impact of streaming services, which offer more diverse viewing options, allowing for greater flexibility in summer entertainment choices.

## Data Description

1.  **Source of Data**: The data comes from IMDb, available via [@TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/readme.md) (dataset released on July 30, 2024).

2.  **Description of Variables in the Dataset**:

    **summer_movies.csv:**

    -   `tconst`: Unique identifier for each title (character)
    -   `title_type`: Format of the title (movie, video, or tvMovie) (character)
    -   `primary_title`: Popular title used for promotion (character)
    -   `original_title`: Original title in the original language (character)
    -   `year`: Release year (integer)
    -   `runtime_minutes`: Primary runtime in minutes (integer)
    -   `genres`: Up to three associated genres (character)
    -   `simple_title`: Lowercase title with punctuation removed (character)
    -   `average_rating`: Weighted average of user ratings on IMDb (double)
    -   `num_votes`: Number of votes received on IMDb (integer)

    **summer_movie_genres.csv:**

    -   `tconst`: Unique identifier for each title (character)
    -   `genres`: Individual genres associated with the title (character) The `summer_movie_genres` dataset contains individual genres associated with each movie.

3.  **Data Cleaning Steps**:

    -   **Handled Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing data entries to ensure completeness and accuracy in the analysis.

    -   **Removed Duplicates**: Checked for and eliminated any duplicate records to avoid over-representation of movies in the dataset.

    -   **Standardized Genre Formats**: Cleaned and standardized genre entries to ensure consistency, allowing for accurate genre analysis and visualization.

    -   **Filtered Out Irrelevant Data**: Removed movies with less than 10 IMDb votes to focus on titles with sufficient audience engagement.

    -   **Converted Data Types**: Ensured all columns, such as `year` and `runtime_minutes`, were in the correct data format (integer or character) for proper analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# snippet of the code which involves data cleaning
summer_movies <- summer_movies %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(genres = str_to_lower(genres))
```

The above code snippet demonstrates handling missing values by removing incomplete entries, eliminating duplicate records for accuracy, and standardizing genre formats by converting them to lowercase for consistency.

## Analysis

Let's dive into the trends and insights we uncovered.

#### Trend in Summer Movie Production

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(scales)
summer_movie_genres <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/summer_movie_genres.csv')
summer_movies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-07-30/summer_movies.csv')
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Number of Summer-Themed Movies Produced Each Year"
#| label: fig-movies
# Preparing the data 
release_timing <- summer_movies %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(movie_count = n()) %>% filter(year<2024)
# Plotting release timing
ggplot(release_timing, aes(x = year, y = movie_count)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year",y = "Number of Movies")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

We can observe a surge in the production of summer-themed movies during the 1980s and 1990s in @fig-movies, suggesting that this period was a golden era for summer films. While the trend fluctuated in the following years, it remains a popular genre with consistent releases.

The data reveals a steady increase in the number of summer-themed movies produced over the decades, particularly from the mid-20th century onward. This rise in production can be attributed to several factors:

-   **Post-War Boom**: After WWII, the entertainment industry flourished, and summer became a prime time for escapist films, reflecting the desire for adventure and relaxation.

-   **1960s-1970s Cultural Shifts**: Films began focusing on youthful rebellion and exploration, with summer releases capturing the spirit of freedom and adventure.

-   **1980s-1990s Blockbuster Era**: Blockbusters like *Jaws* and *Star Wars* set the stage for high-budget summer films, targeting family and younger audiences during school vacations.

-   **Family Films Surge**: From the 1990s onward, studios capitalized on summer vacations by releasing family-oriented films, especially animated and lighthearted comedies.

-   **Streaming & 2000s Shift**: The rise of streaming allowed for year-round releases, but summer remains a key time for big releases to capture large audiences.

-   **Niche Films Growth**: With diverse distribution channels, summer has also become a time for indie films, documentaries, and biopics to shine alongside blockbusters.

-   **Globalization**: The summer release window has expanded globally, targeting international markets like China and India, contributing to increased production.

#### Genre Analysis

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 Genre Distribution of Summer-Themed Movies"
#| label: fig-distribution
# Reordering genres by count in descending order
top_genres <- summer_movie_genres %>%
  count(genres, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>%  
  mutate(genres = fct_reorder(genres, -n)) 

ggplot(top_genres, aes(x = genres, y = n)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Genres", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Drama and comedy take the lead as the most popular genres in summer-themed films followed by romance and documentaries in @fig-distribution. However, the emergence of genres like family and horror, though less prevalent, suggests that there is a niche audience for these films. Interestingly, documentaries also perform well in this dataset, showing that audiences are seeking more than just light-hearted entertainment in the summer—they are also drawn to educational or thought-provoking content.

These findings also highlight how summer-themed films often revolve around emotionally charged narratives, offering the audience an experience of personal growth, adventure, and fun-filled moments that are often associated with the season.

#### Ratings and Popularity

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-top-movies

library(kableExtra)
top_10_movies <- summer_movies %>%
  arrange(desc(average_rating)) %>%  
  select(primary_title, genres, average_rating) %>% head(10)


kable(top_10_movies, 
      col.names = c("Movie Title", "Genres", "Average Rating"),
      caption = "Top 10 Summer-Themed Movies by Average Rating") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, 
                bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered")) %>% row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#6f6fd8") |>  # Header row style
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) 
```

The @tbl-top-movies showcases the diverse range of top-rated summer-themed movies, which span across genres like documentaries, drama, music, and comedy. While lighthearted genres such as comedy and family films remain popular, the high ratings for more serious genres—particularly documentaries—highlight the broad appeal and evolving nature of summer-themed storytelling. The inclusion of music-themed movies among the top-rated films further aligns with the observation that these films resonate strongly with audiences, adding depth to the overall trends in summer movie preferences.

Our analysis reveals clear trends in the popularity of summer-themed movies, showing a dominance of drama and comedy but also a growing diversity in genres.
